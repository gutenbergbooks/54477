<h1>THE STORY OF LIVE DOLLS</h1>

<p>“Look, what’s coming!” and with
a shout of delight the children of Cloverdale
village left their play and
rushed into the street.</p>

<p>What do you think they saw?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>A tiny gilded coach drawn by two
beautiful white kittens, with reins of
blue ribbons covered with silver bells,
and through the coach window the
face of a wonderful doll. On her
head was a jaunty sailor hat, from
under which yellow curls danced in
the wind as she nodded and smiled
at the children on either side.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 180px;">
<img src="images/illus1.jpg" width="180" height="400" alt="Children reading bills" />
</div>

<p>From time to time she tossed out
a handful of bills, which flew about
like little white birds and then fluttered
to the ground, where they were
eagerly caught up by the fast gathering
crowd of children, filled with wonder
at the amazing sight. They made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
brave effort to keep up with the coach;
but the driver cracked his whip, the
kittens started at a mad pace down
the hill, and with one
last nod and smile from
the doll in the window,
the coach disappeared
in a cloud of dust. The
children watched it out
of sight, then turned to
go back.</p>

<p>But what were
these bills which,
in the excitement,
they had forgotten
and were still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
clutching in their hot and dirty hands?
Again and again they read these startling
words, which stared them in the
face:</p>

<div class="box em15">

<p class="center larger">NOTICE!</p>

<p class="center">ON THE MORNING OF
JUNE THE FOURTH ALL
THE DOLLS IN THE VILLAGE
OF CLOVERDALE
WILL BE ALIVE!</p>

</div>

<p>That was all; and it was to happen
to-morrow, for this was the third day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 85px;">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="85" height="200" alt="Two children hugging" />
</div>

<p>They looked at one another with
eyes growing larger and rounder, and
cheeks growing redder than the roses
blossoming in the gardens. Then such
a chatter began that even the birds had
to stop singing to listen.</p>

<p>“I never heard of such a thing!”
“How could they?” “Wouldn’t it be
perfectly lovely?” And suddenly realizing
what a blissful thing was in store
for them, if it were really true, the
children began to hug each other and
dance about and squeal with joy, until
their various mothers came to the windows
to learn the cause of the commotion.
When the little ones caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
sight of them, remembering that they
had not heard the wonderful news,
they shouted:</p>

<p>“Let’s tell our mammas!” and
quickly disappeared.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="300" height="165" alt="Children celebrating the news" />
</div>

<p>Janie Bell’s home was the nearest.
She fairly flew up the steps and tumbled
into the door as she said:</p>

<p>“O mamma, it’s going to begin to-morrow!
Won’t it be lovely! A doll
came in a gold carriage and she threw
this bill, and a boy doll drove the white
kittens all covered with ribbons and
bells, and it was too pretty.…
<em>Do</em> you think my dolls could come
alive?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Mamma wiped the little hot face
and read the bill.</p>

<p>“It does seem strange, but I don’t
know of a lovelier thing that could
happen to a little girl than to have her
doll come to life. What a fine time
there would be in the doll house!”
she said, glancing out of the window
at a beautiful little house under the
trees. It was just like a real house,
with a porch across the front, a real
door bell, tiny shades and Swiss curtains
at the windows, and a little brick
chimney upon the roof.</p>

<p>Janie clapped her hands.</p>

<p>“O mamma, won’t it be fine? I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
hardly wait.” She flew out of the door
and into the doll house.</p>

<p>Each room was in good order, for
Janie was a fine housekeeper. Papa
had given the dolls’ home to her,
thinking that if the little girl learned
to keep this one in order she would
some day be able to take care of a
larger one.</p>

<p>She looked at the parlor with its
mimic furniture, a sofa, chairs, piano,
and a grate where she could build a
fire if mamma were watching. Then
she went into the dining-room, where
the table was set all ready for dinner.
How lovely it would be to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the dolls sitting there and actually
eating!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="200" height="225" alt="Janie peeping into the dolls’ pantry" />
</div>

<p>In the kitchen was a little range
with an oven, and there Dinah, the
black cook, was propped against the
wall, looking as if she were only waiting
for the magic word to set her
marching off getting dinner. Her wig
would probably fall off, as it was loose,
and her leg was broken. Janie resolved
to mend her at once, as it
would not do to have her come alive
in that condition. She peeped into
the dear little pantry at the kettles,
skillets and shining pans on the shelves,
and at the tiny box marked “Cake.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
In one corner was an ice box, in another
a flour barrel.</p>

<p>Upstairs there were dolls of all ages
and sizes; papa, mamma and children.
A little baby in long dresses lay in a
cradle, and other dolls were sitting and
standing about, some dressed and some,
I am sorry to say, stark naked. Janie
dressed and arranged them all in various
attitudes; then, seized with a sudden
inspiration, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Well, if it is true, we’ll have the
best time in this little house we ever
had, and I’m going to get ready for it.”</p>

<p>So she swept it from top to bottom,
washed the little windows, tied back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the pretty curtains with fresh ribbons,
dusted the furniture, made the beds,
washed the dolls’ faces, mended Dinah’s
leg and fastened her wig, flitted about
from room to room, giving each one a
last fond look, and then she locked
the front door and hung the key on
the branch of a tree, where it was
safely hidden by the leaves.</p>

<p>The sun was setting and papas were
coming home to their suppers. All
seemed as usual, but it was a new and
very exciting world to this little mother,
for the morning was to bring strange
doings. Janie hurried in to eat her
supper and to get to bed early.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="300" height="115" alt="Janie dressing and arranging her dolls" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus6.jpg" width="200" height="225" alt="Janie kissing Mamma good-night" />
</div>

<p>“It seems almost like Christmas,
mamma; I can hardly wait for to-morrow,”
she said as she kissed her mother
good-night. Mamma laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“Well, close your bright eyes, and
the birdies will be singing their morning
song before you know it,” she said.
Janie leaned out of bed to kiss her big
dollie, who was sleeping peacefully in
a cradle by her side.</p>

<p>No dollie ever had better care, for
Janie was a kind little mother. She
took her to the table for each meal,
gave her a lovely ride every day, and
at night carefully undressed her and
tucked her into bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Won’t it be beautiful?” Janie
whispered, as she gave the cradle a little
jog. But Dollie slept on, quite unconscious
of the fact that in the morning
she was to be as full of life and
dancing gaiety as Janie herself. As for
Janie, she hardly dared think about it;
for if she once began to imagine what
bliss was in store for her, she would
never get to sleep.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus7.jpg" width="200" height="110" alt="Janie and Dollie riding in an egg-shell coach" />
</div>

<p>During the night she dreamed all
sorts of things. Toward morning it
seemed that she and Dollie were riding
in an egg-shell coach, drawn by two
downy, yellow chickens; Dollie suddenly
stood up and began to sing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
frightening the chickens, so that they
ran away and tipped over the carriage.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus8.jpg" width="250" height="210" alt="The carriage tipping over" />
</div>

<p>Of course, at this catastrophe, Janie
wakened; but her dream seemed to go
on, and she still heard a voice singing.
Could it be her doll?</p>

<p>She hardly dared move, as she remembered
what was to happen to-day.
She listened a moment and then peeped
out. At sight of her, Dollie held up
both arms and said&mdash;yes, actually said:</p>

<p>“O you dear little mamma, I am so
glad you are awake. I want to come
into your bed,” and up she popped
and climbed in under the covers, and
snuggled up exactly as Janie often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
snuggled up to her mamma. Janie
hugged her, but for a moment was too
frightened and astonished to speak.</p>

<p>Miss Dollie began to laugh and giggle
so loud that papa and mamma
came running in.</p>

<p>“It’s true, mamma, it’s true! Look
at her!”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s true,” said Dollie;
“didn’t the Queen of the Dolls decide
that it should be? It had to be true
when she said it. But let’s get up and
dress; you’ll be s’prised to see what’s
happening in the doll house.”</p>

<p>Janie gave a little scream of delight,
hopped out of bed and scrambled into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
her clothes. Dollie was quicker than
she, and was soon dressed and standing
on a chair by the side of the bed; for
Janie had to watch and laugh over the
funny spectacle of Dollie dressing
herself.</p>

<p>“Now brush my hair, please,” pealed
out Miss Dollie as Janie finished.
Janie gave her another hug, as she
brushed the brown curls around her
finger; then they ran pell-mell down
the stairway and raced out of the
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fp2">

<img src="images/fp2.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="" />

<p class="caption">Janie gave a little scream of delight</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The family all laughed heartily, for
it was a funny sight to see a doll run.
They could hardly believe their eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and hurried into their
clothes; for they too were
eager to see these wonderful
doings in the doll house.
As Janie ran across the lawn, she noticed
smoke coming from the chimney.
She flew up the steps, unlocked the
front door and, as she stepped into the
hall, beheld the astonishing sight of
black Dinah at the toy telephone. She
was just saying, “One steak, please,”
and then she called up the grocery
store and ordered a bill of goods that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
would empty almost any housekeeper’s
pocket-book.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus9.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="Janie and Dollie running towards the house" />
</div>

<p>Dinah paid no attention to the visitors,
but swept the front steps, glanced
into the dining-room to see if all was
ready for breakfast, and then went into
the kitchen.</p>

<p>The fire was crackling in the range,
and while Dinah waited for the groceries
Janie ran upstairs. The dolls were
dressing in the different rooms, and
mamma doll was trying to make the
baby comfortable. Its cries soon
brought Dinah up with a cunning milk
bottle, all filled; baby took it and
nestled down into her pillow with it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
just as any baby would who had to be
fed in that horrid way. Janie longed
to pick her up, but as she wished very
much to see Dinah get breakfast, she
thought she would wait until another
time.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus10.jpg" width="250" height="135" alt="Dinah unpacking the grocery delivery" />
</div>

<p>A knock downstairs announced the
grocery boy, and Janie went down to
find the table covered with little packages
containing flour, sugar, coffee,
eggs, and everything needed in a real
kitchen. She longed to help put the
articles in place, but Dinah looked
queer and cross, so she didn’t dare
touch anything. It was no wonder
Dinah was cross, for what do you think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Janie had done in her haste the day
before? She had put the poor thing’s
leg on backward, and had pasted her
wig on crooked, way down over one
ear. So, of course, she wasn’t very
comfortable.</p>

<p>After putting everything away, Dinah
got a dish, broke an egg into it
(such a tiny egg, about as large as a
bird’s), and with a dear little egg-beater
whisked it as light as a feather. Then
she poured in some milk and added
flour, with a little salt and baking-powder.
Janie wondered what she
was going to make and glanced at the
range. “O joy! pancakes!” she cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
as she spied the smoking hot griddle,
the size of a small saucer.</p>

<p>Dinah put on the broiler and laid
the steak carefully on it, cut a potato
into dice and put it into a pan with a
little cream; then, with a dash of salt
and pepper on the steak (which was
soon done to a turn), she placed it on
a platter and generously buttered it.
When all was ready she rang a toy
bell, and the family of dolls filed down
into the dining-room.</p>

<p>They seated themselves, and papa
served the food. When he carved the
steak the knife bent double, for it was
really never meant for use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, I must go and buy another.
I didn’t know it was so poor,” said
mamma doll, as she poured the coffee
into the tiny cups and added cream
and sugar.</p>

<p>How funny they all looked, sitting
there and really eating! Janie tried to
smother a hysterical laugh, and made
such a queer sound that they all looked
up. She felt almost disgraced when
her big doll, who had followed her
about, whispered:</p>

<p>“Come away, or you’ll hurt their
feelings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fp3">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>&nbsp; </p>

<p>And now came Dinah with a plate
of cakes about the size of a penny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Each doll clamored for one. How
good they looked! Janie ran to the
kitchen; she <em>must</em> bake those cakes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 65px;">
<img src="images/illus12.jpg" width="65" height="100" alt="Dinah carrying a plate of cakes" />
</div>

<p>“O Dinah, please let me. I will be
very careful.”</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Janie, you may; but I
am cross to-day. My hair is so crooked,
and look at my leg! How could you
put it on backwards? I have so much
work to do, and it is so hard to walk.”</p>

<p>“Why, Dinah, you poor thing, did
I do that? I will take it right off and
turn it around. It won’t take me
more than a minute, and it will soon
dry.”</p>

<p>Dinah screamed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“What! Don’t you think I have
any feelings? How would you like to
have your papa break your leg and
turn it round, and you sit waiting for
the glue to dry?” and with a scornful
sniff she hobbled in with another plate
of cakes.</p>

<p>When the family had finally finished
eating, there was still considerable batter
left; Janie begged for some cakes
for herself. Dinah consented, and so
Janie and Miss Dollie sat down to eat,
taking care to save some cakes for
Dinah.</p>

<p>It certainly was bliss to watch the
butter melt on those beautiful brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
cakes, and to pour the golden syrup
from the syrup cup, which had come
all the way from Boston only last
Christmas.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they delicious?” said a
piping voice.</p>

<p>Janie jumped up and almost dropped
the syrup cup. She had been so busy
over those darling cakes, that she had
almost forgotten about her doll sitting
opposite her at table.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus13.jpg" width="250" height="125" alt="Janie and Dollie’s tea-party" />
</div>

<p>“O you precious thing! I never can
get used to hearing you talk. How
many times I have played tea-party
here with you, and had to do all the
talking myself!” and she ran round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and gave her another hug. “Let’s go
and tell papa and mamma about the
breakfast,” she added; but as they
stepped outside they found the family
peeping in at the window.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 110px;">
<img src="images/illus14.jpg" width="110" height="250" alt="Janie at the bed-room door" />
</div>

<p>“Isn’t it fun, mamma? And did
you see the cunning pancakes? The
mamma doll is actually going shopping
because my knives won’t cut meat.
The baby was really crying, and I must
go up and see her,” she rattled on,
without giving them time to reply, and
then ran up the stairway with the big
doll tripping after her.</p>

<p>Stopping at the door of the bed-room,
she clasped her hands in rapture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
for mamma doll was giving baby a
bath. It was kicking up its weenty
heels, and gurgling and cooing just
like a real baby. While mamma was
scrubbing, suddenly baby grabbed the
end of the wash-cloth. Of course, it
cried when she took it away, and then
it stopped to listen, for mamma had
wound up the little music box.</p>

<p>So the bath went on till baby was
all clean down to its little toes, which
mamma kissed and folded tenderly in
the blanket. Then she dressed it and
laid it in its cradle.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/illus15.jpg" width="100" height="90" alt="Cradle" />
</div>

<p>Janie made a motion to take it, but
mamma shook her head, and whispering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
that it was asleep, she quietly put
the room in order and drew down the
shades. The doll children were making
a great racket, and mamma called
to them to run out and play, so baby
could sleep. Janie and Miss Dollie
followed.</p>

<p>As they passed through the kitchen,
Dinah was just finishing a marvelous
pie, as large as a silver dollar, and singing
“Der’s a good time comin’ by and
by.” As she opened the oven door
Janie caught a glimpse of a dear little
bird roasting, and oh! how good it
smelled! A dish of cranberries was
cooling in the window, and as Dinah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
left the room for a moment, Janie
couldn’t resist peeping into the ice
box. There was a block of real ice,
and a pan of milk with cream on the
top of it. How she longed to skim it
with the little skimmer!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/illus16.jpg" width="150" height="125" alt="Dinah" />
</div>

<p>Then she espied a dish of something
that looked like custard, which she was
about to taste when Dinah’s voice
startled her.</p>

<p>“What you a-doin’ in my ice box?”</p>

<p>“I only wanted to know what that
was,” said Janie respectfully, for she
was a little afraid of Dinah since the
leg affair.</p>

<p>“It’s for ice cream, an’ I’se a notion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
ter let you freeze it. I’se got a heap
of work dis mornin’.”</p>

<p>“O Dinah, may I?” and Janie
danced a hornpipe then and there and
threw her arms around Dinah’s neck.</p>

<p>“You are a dear, and I am sorry I
put your leg on wrong. I do wish I
could fix it.”</p>

<p>“Nebber mind, honey; I couldn’t
go through wid dat operation nohow,”
said Dinah, as she got the freezer and
chopped the ice into bits, then poured
in the custard and left it for Janie to
finish.</p>

<p>With her dear companion by her
side she worked until the handle began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to turn hard, when she knew it
was frozen.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 85px;">
<img src="images/illus17.jpg" width="85" height="150" alt="Janie licking the ladder" />
</div>

<p>“Dinah, can’t we lick the ladder?
Mamma always lets me.”</p>

<p>Dinah said she might, and she dutifully
gave Dollie half. She was sorely
tempted to get a spoon and taste that
in the freezer, as Dinah had left the
room, but she knew that would not be
honest, so she covered it up and ran
into the yard to see the doll children
at play.</p>

<p>She was just in time to see, coming
slowly down the street, a white, covered
wagon, marked in red letters,
“Dolls’ Ambulance.” It was drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
by six white kittens, who moved along
so carefully that Janie decided they
must have some very sick patients
aboard. It halted in front of the doll
house, and the little Queen dismounted,
saying she was going to telephone.
Meantime Janie, curious to
see what was within, walked around to
the back and peeped in at the little
open door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fp4">

<img src="images/fp4.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="" />

<p class="caption">Janie saw a most piteous sight</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>There she saw a most piteous sight.
It was filled with dolls of all sizes, and
in such a condition! Arms and legs
were off, wigs were missing, and some
dolls lay with their poor sightless eyes
staring up at her, in such a pathetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
manner, that Janie could hardly keep
back the tears. One poor little thing
lay apart from the others and was dripping
wet. Her companions sobbed
aloud as they told in low tones of how
she was fished out of a water barrel,
stone dead. Not even the Queen
could bring her to life.</p>

<p>Each had some trouble. Some told
of how their mammas had lost their
arms and legs, and how their wigs had
been off for weeks. Some were sadly
neglected, many being wrapped in small
bed-quilts and soiled blankets, as they
hadn’t a stitch to put on. They told
Janie that the Queen had appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
that morning, had gathered them up
from their different homes, and was
going to take them to a dolls’ hospital.
She was telephoning now to make
preparations for their arrival.</p>

<p>The Queen soon appeared, and their
piteous wailing ceased as she hovered
over them, soothing this one and that,
placing some in more comfortable positions,
wiping away tears which were
rolling down the cheeks of little handless
dolls, and telling them all to cheer
up, that they would soon be made as
good as new, except the poor dead
one, which they would lay away tenderly
in some quiet spot and cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
with pretty flowers. The Queen invited
Janie’s doll to go with them, and
as they slowly departed, Janie looked
so wistfully after them that she called
to her to jump onto her wheel and follow.
Janie ran in to ask mamma,
and was soon spinning along after
them.</p>

<p>By and by they turned into a country
road and down a long lane, at the
end of which she saw a high wall. The
Queen told them that it enclosed a
number of acres of land, and that the
place was called the “Doll Farm.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus18.jpg" width="250" height="230" alt="A procession of dolls" />
</div>

<p>They all alighted before a great gate
and the Queen blew a wee silver bugle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
that hung by a silver chain from her
belt. The gate swung open, and when
they had all entered it closed
immediately after them. The
Queen led them up a
path towards a
building bearing the
sign “The Dolls’
Hospital.”
Janie was too
much astonished
at the sight that
met her eyes to follow.
All she could see was an orchard
of low trees, whose branches hung full
of doll clothes, swaying in the cool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
morning air. There were tiny under-garments,
and dresses of all colors.
She reached out to examine a particularly
pretty one, and to see just how it
was made, when a voice startled her.</p>

<p>“Don’t touch that. It isn’t ripe
yet.”</p>

<p>“Ripe!” said Janie. “Is it growing?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course. Now see. The
button holes aren’t begun yet, and the
buttons aren’t near tight enough. It
will be about two weeks before that
frock can be picked. Now here is one
I can pick to-morrow,” and he explained
to Janie just how he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
tell when it was ready to be removed
from the tree.</p>

<p>Then the gardener, for it was he,
showed her the trees full of under-garments
and dear little petticoats, the
bushes of different colored stockings,
with shoes and slippers to match, and
last of all, a tree of hats. They were
the sweetest things, of many different
shapes, and from the end of each
branch hung bright ribbons of all colors.
Near by grew all sorts of flowers.</p>

<p>The gardener told Janie she might
trim a few of the hats, if she cared to,
as they were all ready to pick. Now,
if there was one thing Janie liked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
more than another, it was to trim hats.
So the gardener picked a number and
allowed her to choose the ribbons and
flowers.</p>

<p>She chose red, blue, pink and white
ribbons, and roses, forget-me-nots,
pansies and morning-glories. You
must remember these were all dwarf
flowers, much smaller than ours, and
the gardener told her they were everlasting,
and so would not wither.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 90px;">
<img src="images/illus19.jpg" width="90" height="200" alt="Ribbons and parasols" />
</div>

<p>Janie seated herself under a tree,
from whose branches dainty parasols of
all colors were dancing and nodding
in the breeze. She would have been
eager to pick them at any other time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
but now with her lap full of such visions
of beauty, she was blind to everything
else about her. She arranged the
bows and flowers, and soon had this lot
of hats trimmed, and begged for more.
Finishing a number she placed them
in long rows on the shelves built for
that purpose.</p>

<p>She then threw herself on the
ground to rest, and, glancing up, saw
the parasols.</p>

<p>She clapped her hands and bounded
to her feet.</p>

<p>“O Mr. Gardener, can’t I have one?”</p>

<p>He said she might, and asked her
which one she wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus20.jpg" width="400" height="315" alt="Janie trying to choose from the tree" />
</div>

<p>“That beautiful
blue one. No, the pink
one. O no, wait a moment,
that white one, I
think. O, Mr. Gardener,
please let me
look a moment. They
are all so sweet!” She finally decided
on the blue&mdash;a beauty with lace and
forget-me-nots around the top.</p>

<p>The pink one had a wreath of wild
roses, and it was hard to give that up;
but the blue matched her doll’s new
dress, and so that decided it. Then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
gardener told her that after awhile she
could help him pick the various garments
for the army of dolls that had
just arrived, but that now she’d better
go into the hospital and see what they
were doing there. And so he led her
into the house.</p>

<p>Here Janie found the poor crippled
dolls being put in fine shape by little
doll nurses, wearing soft gray dresses
with white aprons and caps. Legs and
arms were being replaced; the blind
were made to see with blue eyes and
brown; bald heads were covered, and
such a wealth of hair did those dolls
have&mdash;some curly, some braided and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
tied with a ribbon, and some
hanging straight, for the dolls’ mammas
to braid or curl, as they chose. When
their bodies had finally reached perfection,
they went into a bath-room
for a sorely-needed bath, and Janie
went to help the gardener.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus21.jpg" width="400" height="150" alt="Dolls being tended in hospital beds" />
</div>

<p>Together they wandered about,
plucking an outfit for each doll. It
was great fun to match the dresses in
slippers and stockings, and then to
complete the costumes with the proper
hats. When they carried the frocks in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
what a hubbub arose! Each doll
wanted every dress.</p>

<p>The little Queen quieted them and
gave a suit to each one, which they
soon put on, and they looked so sweet,
clean and pretty that their own mammas
would hardly know them. The
Queen called for the bill, paid it, and
departed with her family, looking like
the “Old Woman Who Lived in a
Shoe.”</p>

<p>They made a very pretty picture as
they walked out, appearing like a lot
of gorgeous butterflies. As before, the
gate swung open at a peal from the
silver bugle; all climbed into the ambulance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
once more, and away they
went with Janie following.</p>

<p>When they reached home they
found the yard full of little girls weeping
for their lost dolls. But as each
dollie jumped down and ran to its own
mamma, what a chattering and babbling
filled the air!</p>

<p>“Who mended you?” “What lovely
hair!” “Where did you get those
clothes?” cried the little girls.</p>

<p>The strange tale which Janie told
them of all she had seen, and especially
of the clothes growing on trees, seemed
too wonderful to be believed, and they
envied her such delightful experiences.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus22.jpg" width="400" height="130" alt="Dolls in their new finery" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The little Queen then mounted the
steps and gave them a short lecture.
She told them how kind they ought
always to be to their dolls&mdash;just as
kind as they wished their mammas to
be to them.</p>

<p>She said that when she went from
house to house gathering up all the old
dollies to have them made like new,
she was shocked to see the condition
of some of them. One had a hopeless
crack in its head, because its mamma
got cross and threw it up to the ceiling.
Some of them were naked, and
most of them were very dirty. Her
eyes filled with tears as she spoke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the poor little dead one; and she said
she could always tell what kind of
heart a little girl had by the way she
treated her doll. Those who made the
sweetest and tenderest mammas were
those who had taken the most loving
care of their dollies when they were
little girls. She wanted them to begin
over, and see who could be the best
mother during the few weeks that followed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus23.jpg" width="400" height="150" alt="The Queen lecturing the little girls" />
</div>

<p>Then they all sat on the grass,
and Dinah appeared with cunning
glasses of lemonade and tiny sandwiches,
and they enjoyed this almost
more than the lecture. When they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
had finished the Queen said good-by,
telling them to enjoy each other while
they could, as this bliss was to last but
a month.</p>

<p>Only little girls with live dolls can
know of the happiness that followed.
It was no uncommon thing to see dolls
playing “ring-around-a-rosy” and
“hide-and-seek,” or jumping ropes and
rolling hoops. Janie never tired of
watching them, and she and her precious
doll had many romps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fp5">

<img src="images/fp5.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="" />

<p class="caption">The dolls playing “ring-around-a-rosy”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Early one morning there was left at
the door a miniature invitation, which
announced that a picnic was to be held
at the Doll Farm the next day. Janie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
ran into the doll house to ask if they
would go, and found Dinah busy cooking
for it. She had just finished the
layer cakes, which had been baked in
the lids of baking-powder cans. They
were all iced, some with chocolate,
others with plain white. A number of
tiny square loaves of angel food and
sponge cake looked so good that Janie
longed to pocket one.</p>

<p>Dinah allowed her to cut out the
fried cakes with a thimble, and when
they were a golden brown, she rolled
them in pulverized sugar until they
looked like a heap of white marbles.
Dinah then made a batch of cookies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
which Janie cut also. Next came a
lot of jelly tarts and apple turn-overs,
so crisp they would undoubtedly melt
in your mouth.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, she made dozens
of the dearest little baking-powder biscuits,
and when they were baked Janie
opened and buttered them and put in
pieces of dried beef, shaved very thin.
They were delicious. Janie received
one from Dinah, and longed to swallow
a dozen.</p>

<p>Then Dinah boiled a number of
eggs, for which Janie tied up packages
of salt and pepper, as these are necessary
for every picnic. She then helped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to place the food on the pantry shelf,
ready to pack in a hamper the next
morning.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus24.jpg" width="300" height="230" alt="Janie placing the food on the pantry shelf" />
</div>

<p>How tempting it looked! When
they had squeezed lemons for lemonade
and frozen the ice cream, they sat
down to rest.</p>

<p>Dinah said it was to be a delightful
picnic, given by the Queen to all the
dolls and their mammas. Every little
girl in the village was invited, and she
did hope she had enough to eat!</p>

<p>Janie ran home to tell mamma
about it, and to ask if she couldn’t
make something for the lunch. Mamma
thought for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know the very thing,” she said.
“Jump onto your wheel and go to
each little girl’s house, and tell her to
be here at three this afternoon, and to
be sure to wear an old dress.”</p>

<p>“You are the darlingest mamma!”
Janie cried, as she hugged her and ran
away with a delightful feeling of mystery.
“It must be lovely if mamma
planned it, but what <em>can</em> it be?”</p>

<p>Promptly at three all were on hand.
Mamma took them to the kitchen.</p>

<p>“We will make some doll candy,
and I will show you how,” she said.</p>

<p>They had to relieve their excited
feelings by dancing a jig at this delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
news, and then they settled
down to work. They first made some
chocolate drops, the weentiest little
things you ever saw; then some marshmallows,
which were about the size of
parchesi dice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus25.jpg" width="400" height="200" alt="The girls in the kitchen making candy" />
</div>

<p>Next they made maple-creams and
dear old-fashioned molasses candy,
which the children were allowed to
pull, and the one who succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
getting her piece the whitest was to
have a dainty little box of the mixed
candies.</p>

<p>It was great fun! When it was finished
it looked so good that mamma
had to divide a box among them. Then
she brought out the popper, and the
children went gaily about shelling the
corn. This is always a delight to pop,
and when they had a heaping dish of
it, they made it into popcorn balls
about the size of marbles.</p>

<p>While they waited for the candy
to harden they ran into the garden
to play and to talk over these strange
happenings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“O children, what lovely times we
are having!” said Janie. “I wish they
could last always.” And each one
piped in:</p>

<p>“Yes, but they can’t, and we must
enjoy them while they do last.”</p>

<p>“I know one thing, I do take better
care of my doll now. I never used
to keep her face clean, and she was
nearly always naked.”</p>

<p>“It was mine that was ruined from
my throwing her up to the wall. I
was so mad at her that day, just because
I couldn’t make her dress fit. I
have a new one now, and I am very
careful of her.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 285px;">
<img src="images/illus26.jpg" width="285" height="400" alt="A girl throwing a doll up in the air" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“And mine was drowned, but I really
was sorry after I did it. She
wouldn’t stand up, and I grew cross
and threw her into the water; but, of
course, I never knew she had any feelings.
There goes my new one now,
riding the wheel which papa had made
for her.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 90px;">
<img src="images/illus27.jpg" width="90" height="150" alt="A doll riding a bicycle" />
</div>

<p>The girls clapped their hands with
delight at the unusual spectacle. To
think of a doll on a wheel! What
would happen next?</p>

<p>Just then mamma’s voice summoned
them to the kitchen, where they found
a great basket of little candy boxes in
the forms of hearts, diamonds, half-moons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
drums and cunning barrels.
They packed the candy neatly and tied
each box with a pretty ribbon.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus28.jpg" width="350" height="260" alt="A tallyho drawn by four dogs" />
</div>

<p>Then the boxes were placed in the
basket, ready for the morrow, and the
little girls departed for their homes.
The next day proved to be fine, and
soon after breakfast
the children
and their dolls
were assembled
in Janie’s yard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
They were clad in pretty dresses, and
looked as sweet and fresh as a lot of
daisies.</p>

<p>Then appeared two tallyhos, the
one for the dolls being drawn by four
curly white dogs. The Queen’s own
boy-doll driver snapped the whip, and
the air was at once filled with the noise
of the barking of the dogs and the
music of the bells on the harness of
the restless steeds.</p>

<p>The tallyho for the children was
much larger, and was drawn by four
cream-white ponies.</p>

<p>They were all packed in like sardines
in a box, the little Queen sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in the midst of the dolls. The silver
bugle was blown, the chains and bells
jangled, and away they flew.</p>

<p>They were barely started when they
heard Dinah calling. She was frantically
waving a red bandanna kerchief
and beckoning them to come back.
So back they went.</p>

<p>“You done forgot me,” she shouted.</p>

<p>“You! Why, Dinah, are you going?”
asked Janie.</p>

<p>“Co’se I is, and I don’t like to take
no liberties nor nothin’, but I feel like
I must tell you dat you done forgot
anodder t’ing dat I consider mighty
impo’tant to ebery picnic, and dat is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
de lunch what I’se been workin’ at
dis long time.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 130px;">
<img src="images/illus29.jpg" width="130" height="150" alt="Picnic baskets" />
</div>

<p>This speech caused a hearty shout
of laughter. Mamma came to help
put in the hamper and baskets, and
Dinah sat in state by the driver. With
her red kerchief on her head and her
yellow dress, she looked like a great
bumble-bee hovering over the dainty
doll flowers.</p>

<p>As they rode away, mamma heard
her singing her favorite song, “Der’s a
good time comin’ by and by.” Perhaps
she was thinking of the time when
her leg would be turned around, or,
perhaps, of how much they would enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the toothsome luncheon she had
prepared. They had a fine ride, as it
was a beautiful day, and they were all
so perfectly happy.</p>

<p>They sang and shouted, and were
envied by all the boys in the village,
who were deprived of these pleasures
because boys are so dreadful in their
treatment of dolls.</p>

<p>All too soon was the ride at an end.
The girls were eager to see the trees
where the dolls’ clothes grew, and
when they were actually inside of those
wonderful grounds, they ran here and
there like ants. The Queen first
led them around to her own home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
which Janie had not seen when she
was there before. It was the dearest
little place, with climbing rose vines
twined about the doors and windows,
and was beautifully furnished with
everything one could wish for.</p>

<p>The Queen’s own bed-room was
like fairy land. The bed had Swiss
curtains draped about it, tied back
with blue ribbons. There was a lovely
desk filled with tiny doll-paper and
envelopes, and a little gold pen and a
cut-glass inkstand. Here she had written
those gracious invitations.</p>

<p>The closet was filled with beautiful
little dresses. A shoe box held various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
colored shoes and slippers, also bed
slippers and a dear little pair of rubbers.
On the dresser was everything
any young lady could desire. It was
charmingly arranged with a lace cover
over blue, and a dainty pin cushion,
silver comb, brush and manicure set.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus30.jpg" width="300" height="180" alt="The Queen’s bed-room" />
</div>

<p>In one corner stood a book case,
filled with books of the tiniest sort. A
long window led out into a balcony;
here was stretched a doll’s hammock,
where one could swing and pick
flowers without moving, for the roses
twined in and out.</p>

<p>After this they went to see the hospital,
and then to have some games<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
with the dolls. They examined the
trees carefully and found them most
mysterious. Lunch was called before
they dreamed it could be time, and, as
that is always the best part of a picnic,
and as little girls are always hungry,
they hurried to the spot where Dinah
was serving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fp6">

<img src="images/fp6.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="" />

<p class="caption">Have you ever had a dolls’ tea-party?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Every mamma sat by her own doll,
and as the food was passed each doll
helped herself, but the poor mammas
were like the little pig that had none,
as they were not allowed to take a
morsel; and to make it worse, what
do you think those saucy dollies did?
Have you ever had a dolls’ tea party?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Then you remember how you held the
food to your doll’s mouth, pretended
to let her have some, and then gobbled
it up yourself.</p>

<p>Well, that is just what happened
here. Each doll held it to her mamma’s
mouth, and, as she tried to take it,
it vanished in the doll’s mouth in the
most irritating manner. Every time
Dinah passed the same performance followed,
and how the dolls laughed!</p>

<p>The children grew hungrier every
moment when they found those tempting
viands were not for them. The
ice cream looked so delicious! It was
strawberry, and served in small salt-cellars;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and then came that lovely
angel food and jelly tarts. They
coaxed and pleaded, but the dolls
only said:</p>

<p>“That’s the way you treat us at
your parties.”</p>

<p>Finally, when they were on the
verge of tears, the dolls relented and
Dinah brought in a fresh supply, which
vanished very quickly, as everything
was unusually good and the children
were nearly starved.</p>

<p>When they had finished, they presented
the dolls with the boxes of
candy, and wound up with a merry
game of hide-and-seek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The old gardener called them and
said that each little girl was to be allowed
to choose one entire suit for her
doll. What a scramble they made
for the various trees, though it
was very hard to decide, for everything
was so pretty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus31.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Dolls and girls playing outdoors" />
</div>

<p>Janie looked a long time before
she could quite make up her
mind, but finally chose a
pink dress with pink stockings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and slippers, and a hat with elegant
pink plumes waving upon it; a
fan and chatelaine completed this costume.
She chose also the dear pink
parasol she had so much wanted before.
There were also stunning coats
and opera capes with swan’s-down
trimming, and one tree full of dear
little muffs.</p>

<p>The handkerchief tree looked too
funny, with the tiny white things fluttering
about like a flock of birds with
wings spread ready to fly.</p>

<p>It was a hard matter to leave this
enchanting place, but as the sun was
getting low they gathered up their baskets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
presented the gardener with some
of their candy, and with many thanks
and good-bys departed.</p>

<p>When they reached home they told
the Queen they never in all their lives
had had such a beautiful time, and,
thanking her very heartily for giving
them so much pleasure, they went to
their homes “to tell mamma all
about it.”</p>

<p>The days flew merrily by, and before
they realized it the month was
almost gone. When Janie stopped to
think of those happy times being no
more, she was ready to cry her eyes
out, but she put away the thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
determined to enjoy them while they
lasted. One morning at breakfast
papa said:</p>

<p>“Mamma, I think we must wind up
these remarkable doings with something
pretty fine. How would it do
to hire several carriages and take the
whole caboodle of these chicks, with
their wound-up dolls, for a lovely day
at the seashore? The various mothers,
or rather grandmothers, of the dolls
can go to see that they don’t get
drowned. It is only a drive of ten or
twelve miles to the beach. You can
get dinner at the hotel. I will telegraph
and have that arranged for. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
can all have a plunge in the surf, and
the babes can dig in the sand and paddle
about, and have no end of a good
time. How does that strike you,
Janie?”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 70px;">
<img src="images/illus32.jpg" width="70" height="150" alt="Invitations" />
</div>

<p>Janie replied by springing into his
lap and giving him a hug that almost
choked him.</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be lovely,” she cried,
“and I will write the invitations.”</p>

<p>They decided to have it the very
last day of this eventful month. Janie
wrote the notes which were to make
so many hearts happy, and papa went
to make the necessary arrangements.
The day came, and Janie sprang out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of bed to raise the shade. Instead of
seeing the sun streaming in, as she
hoped, she found the rain was pouring
down in sheets. She made a brave
effort to keep back the tears, as she
heard her dollie singing the well-known
song, “Can’t we Make Sunshine
in the House when there is None
Without?”</p>

<p>“But, Dollie, we can’t go,” sobbed
Janie.</p>

<p>“Why not?” came from mamma’s
room.</p>

<p>“Because it’s raining, mamma,” and
then the tears began to fall in earnest.</p>

<p>“Rain before seven, clear before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
eleven,” sang papa. “Don’t borrow
trouble, Polly love, but get dressed
and see what will happen.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/illus33.jpg" width="80" height="150" alt="Waterproof and rubbers" />
</div>

<p>Janie dried her eyes and obeyed,
very much surprised, for she was seldom
allowed to go anywhere in a rain
like that.</p>

<p>After breakfast mamma got out
waterproof and rubbers, which Janie
put on, and then waited patiently for
what would follow.</p>

<p>The door-bell rang and a package
was left for Janie’s doll. On opening
it she found another tiny package
marked on the outside, “Not to be
opened until you reach the beach.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
There was also a little gossamer and a
pair of rubbers, which fitted Miss Dollie
to perfection. How charming she
looked!</p>

<p>Janie hopped about like a young
robin, as she heard the delightful
blast from the trumpet, which was
always associated with their good
times. She rushed to the window and
saw, drawing up in front, two omnibuses,
one filled with the various mothers,
the other with the little girls and
their dollies. But what was this procession
which followed?</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma! it’s all the dolls from
the doll-house, and each has on a tiny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
gossamer. How funny they
look!” And so they did,
each carrying an umbrella
and paddling through the
water. Mamma, Janie and
Dollie followed them, and
all jumped in the omnibuses,
closed the doors with
a bang, and away they went.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/illus34.jpg" width="225" height="400" alt="A procession of dolls with umbrellas" />
</div>

<p>It was snug and cozy
inside. The rain pattered
on the roof and
played a steady accompaniment
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the chatter of this jolly little crowd,
which looked so odd, hooded and
cloaked in black, like so many nuns.
The little mammas cast many admiring
glances at their dolls, for they had
always longed for them to have these
wee rainy-day garments.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it the greatest fun?” they
cried. “I’m so glad it rained; it’s
much nicer to be shut in here and
listen to it,” and they hugged one another
in their delight.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus35.jpg" width="400" height="150" alt="Girls and dolls on the journey" />
</div>

<p>They had a merry ride. The Queen
told some delightful stories, which
were so interesting that when the sun
broke through the clouds they never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
noticed it; till, the last story being finished,
they all shouted in one breath:</p>

<p>“Look at the sun!”</p>

<p>And now they found they were nearing
the beach. They could hear the
ocean roaring, and could see the waves
creeping up and rolling over with that
great swish, which once heard is never
forgotten, and is sweetest music to
lovers of the sea.</p>

<p>The ’buses stopped, then all tumbled
out and made a mad rush for the
water. Oh, the beauty of it all! How
sweet the air was! Who can breathe
that delightful, salty odor and not love
it? They played in the sand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
gathered shells until eleven o’clock,
when the air was warmer, and mamma
said they might put on their bathing
suits.</p>

<p>“But what will the dollies do?”</p>

<p>Janie’s doll waved her mysterious
package, and every other doll waved
one also, crying:</p>

<p>“Wait and you will see.”</p>

<p>Then all disappeared in the bath-houses;
the girls hurried into their suits
and awaited the dollies’ reappearance
with the greatest impatience. When
they finally came they pranced around
them and cried, “Oh, you darlings,
where did you get them?” And no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
wonder, for they were clad in the gayest
little bathing suits you ever saw,
with all the colors of the rainbow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus36.jpg" width="400" height="230" alt="Girls and dolls paddling at the beach" />
</div>

<p>How pretty they looked skipping
about! They had a merry game of
tag, while waiting for the dolls’ grandmammas
to disrobe, and made a beautiful
picture, dotting the sand with
dainty bits of bright color. At last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
all were ready, and they plunged into
the surf. Such fun as they had!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 90px;">
<img src="images/illus37.jpg" width="90" height="150" alt="Girls and dolls paddling at the beach" />
</div>

<p>The storm had made frothy, snowy
waves, which came in faster and faster,
tumbling over each other, as if to see
which would reach the shore first. The
children and dolls took hold of hands
and rushed in among them, only to be
hurled back in one confused mass of
legs, arms and heads. For a moment
it would have been hard for an onlooker
to tell just what it was, but
the tangle soon unraveled, and the
performance was repeated with an accompaniment
of wild shrieks of laughter,
as the waves rushed over the heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of dollies, children and mammas. The
mammas were soon tired out and sat
on the beach to rest and watch this
performance on nature’s stage, and, as
the waves tossed the children and dolls
out on the sand, they laughed till the
tears ran down their cheeks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus38.jpg" width="400" height="150" alt="Girls and dolls sitting on the beach" />
</div>

<p>Some of the dolls were left standing
on their heads, others walking about
on their hands, and one poor little doll
was stuck in the sand, with one leg and
an arm sticking up in the air. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
helped her out and she ran into the
water again, undaunted at such a slight
mishap. At last they came out breathless
and lay down on the sand to rest
before dressing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus39.jpg" width="400" height="235" alt="Children hung on the line to dry" />
</div>

<p>They looked so funny, that mamma
told them she ought to do with them
as did an old lady that she once heard
of, who allowed her children to play
near a little stream which ran by their
home. When they fell in she hung
them on a line and fastened them with
clothes-pins, stuck through their toes.
It was so odd to see them hanging in
a row&mdash;ten of them! When they were
dry she took them in, sprinkled and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
ironed them, and let them loose again.
They were hung so low it really didn’t
hurt them, and they thought it great
fun. One day she left them hanging
while she went to the store, and a
thunder shower came up. She rushed
home in a panic and, of course, found
them dripping. She took out the
clothes-pins, shooed them into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
house like a brood of chickens, gave
them each some ginger tea and hustled
them into bed, piling blankets upon
them till they were nearly smothered.
They recovered, of course.</p>

<p>“And now,” said mamma, “we must
get dressed and go to dinner.”</p>

<p>They all had a hearty laugh over
this remarkable tale, and thought
mamma would have to have a great
many clothes-pins and a very long line
upon which to hang them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fp7">

<p class="caption">The dolls ate a hearty dinner</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>When all were ready they walked
up to the hotel, where the guests were
eagerly waiting for them. They had
seen the telegram which ordered dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to be prepared for thirty mothers,
thirty children and thirty live dolls,
and they watched with the greatest interest
the little girls, each with a doll
by her side, march into the dining-room.
How astonished they were
when they saw the dolls eat&mdash;actually
put food into their mouths and swallow
it. That was the strangest thing!
The dolls weren’t a bit embarrassed,
however, and ate a hearty dinner and
enjoyed it, too, for the long ride and
the bathing had given them fine appetites.</p>

<p>After it was over they filed out, and
the guests after them. The grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
people begged the mothers to tell them
what it all meant, and their children
surrounded the little girls and their
dolls. Of course, the story that they
heard was very strange and hard to believe,
but they could see this part of it
with their own eyes, and so could not
but believe the rest.</p>

<p>All too soon came the omnibuses to
carry them home. They were to have
a pleasant open-air ride this time, as
the roofs had mysteriously disappeared.
With many good-bys they departed,
leaving the guests with much to talk
about. This had been another beautiful
time, and it seemed a fitting end to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the month’s jubilee; but Janie couldn’t
be quite happy, when she remembered
it was the final act in this strange play.</p>

<p>“Dear little Queen,” she pleaded,
“couldn’t you let it last just a little
longer? We can’t bear to give up
these good times so soon.”</p>

<p>“My precious child, this must be
the end for the present&mdash;I always keep
my word, and the month will be up in
the morning; but,” she added, as the
tears sprang to all of those bright eyes,
“if you take good care of your dolls
and try to be helpful to your mammas,
I will let it happen again some day,
and you may then have even a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
time; so do not grieve. Remember,
dear little ones, I love you with all my
heart, and will plan something even
more beautiful than this has been.”</p>

<p>And now she bade the driver stop
at the Doll Farm, where was waiting
the same wee coach which had so
startled them at the beginning of this
remarkable month. A little trunk
strapped on the back said plainer than
words that these times were truly at
an end. Giving each a loving good-by
kiss, and begging them not to be unhappy,
the Queen jumped into the gay
little coach and was whirled away.
The children were driven to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
separate homes, each hugging her doll
and loath to give it up to its former
existence. Janie tried to brighten up,
as she bade them all good-by, and said:
“It will happen again. The Queen
said it would, and it will; so we ought
to be extra good. We have had a delightful
time and must be thankful for
it, and just think what we have to look
forward to!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/illus40.jpg" width="165" height="200" alt="Janie cuddling her doll" />
</div>

<p>That night she tucked in her dollie
as usual, and, after one last fond kiss
and a few extra caresses, was soon in
the beautiful land of dreams, where we
will leave her till the “next time,”
which, as the Queen always tells the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
truth, must surely come some day.
Perhaps it will be in the winter, when
they can have merry sleigh rides and
snow-ball battles. And perhaps, as we
listen to the chimes of the Christmas
bells, if we peep through a window
of the doll house, we shall see a
tiny Christmas tree and “stockings
hung by the chimney with care,” and
even hear dear old Santa Claus’ sleigh-bells,
the reindeer pawing on the
snowy roof, and his great voice crying,
“Merry Christmas to all, and to all a
good night!”</p>

<p>That would indeed be a perfect
time, so we will not be sad at bidding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the dolls good-by, but, as the curtain
falls on this act, sing with dear old

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
